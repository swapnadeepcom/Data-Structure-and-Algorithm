## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears **at most** **twice**, return *an array of all the integers that appears **twice***.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses only *constant* auxiliary space, excluding the space needed to store the output

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: [1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- Each element in `nums` appears **once** or **twice**.

## Solution

### `0442-find-all-duplicates-in-an-array.java`

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  int index = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1;

  if (nums[index] < 0) {
      result.add(index + 1);
  } else {
      nums[index] = -nums[index];
  }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
